### ✅ Key Fixes in This Version:
- Proper formatting of code blocks and sections
- Fixed misplaced headings (e.g. “Getting Started” was in the wrong place before)
- Corrected markdown syntax (your version had raw text like `yaml Copy Edit`)
- Added working link structure and placeholders (replace screenshot when ready)
